# GhostZ
> *aka **Better Soul Lantern***

a lightweight mod for **Fabric**, Minecraft 1.19.4

! *currently in development, cosmetic block only* !

## Plans
- add a unique item **Ghost Lantern**, which:
  - is an upgrade of vanilla **Soul Lantern**
  - functions as a placeable **light source**
  - can place small **wisps** - temporary light sources, draining **souls meter**, wisps can be sucked all at once to restore the meter
  - **levels up** during your adventures (by killing mobs)
  - gives **bonuses** to player while in inventory
  - looks cool!
- add small graveyard world gen with naturally spawned **Ghost Lantern**
- *...ghosts?*

### Possible improvements
- Animated models / textures
- Better Ghost Lantern tooltip
